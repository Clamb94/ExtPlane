~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Downloading *

Binaries for various platforms are available in binaries/ directory. Just
download a suitable binary and copy it to X-Plane/Resources/plugins/extplane.xpl.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Common build requirements *

Copy X-Plane SDK to home directory, so that the headers can be found
at ~/SDK/CHeaders/XPLM (or edit the .pro file).

You'll need Qt development libraries installed.

* To build on Mac & Linux *

$ qmake
$ make

Mac notes:

Warning! If you see any error or warning like :
   ld: in /opt/local/lib/libxslt.1.dylib, file was built for unsupported file format which is not the architecture being linked (i386)

You need to rebuild libxslt with the +universal variant on MacPort otherwise the plugin cannot be loaded by X-Plane !
You should get the same for qt4-mac also.

 * To test *

Launch X-Plane in console and observe the output. You should see something like:
TcpServer::TcpServer(QObject*, DataRefProvider*) Listening on port 51000

Open another console and run 'telnet localhost 51000'

When connected, try typing the following commands:

sub sim/cockpit/electrical/night_vision_on
set sim/cockpit/electrical/night_vision_on 1
set sim/cockpit/electrical/night_vision_on 0
sub sim/flightmodel/position/local_y 100
set sim/flightmodel/position/local_y 3000
key 0
key 0
disconnect

 * Command reference *

Datarefs:
sub <dataref> [accuracy]   - Subscribe to dataref, with optional accuracy.
unsub <dataref>            - Unsubscribe dataref.
set <dataref> <value>      - Set dataref to value. Dataref must be subscribed first.

With accuracy you can decide how much the dataref's value can
change before a update is sent. Set it to as large value as possible
to maximize frame rate and minimize network traffic.

List of datarefs can be found at:
http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.txt

Keys and buttons:
key <key id>               - Create a command key press.
but <button id>            - Press down an button.
rel <button id>            - Release button pressed using "but" command.

List of key and button id's can be found at:
http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/mediawiki/XPLMUtilities
Note that the key and button id's are numbers, not names. X-Plane does not
provide a way to lookup keys or buttons by name.

Other:

disconnect                 - Disconnect the TCP socket.

 * Plugin output *

EXTPLANE <version>             - Sent when connected. Version number is currently 1.
u<type> <dataref> <value>      - Update of dataref

ExtPlane plugin outputs some log to stdout, so if you have problems with the
plugin, start X-Plane in console and read the output.

 * Features *

 - Multiple concurrent connections
 - Set and get datarefs
 - Dataref types: int, float and double
 - Simulate key and button presses
