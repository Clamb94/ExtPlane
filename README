X-Plane plugin that allows commanding X-Plane from external programs using TCP protocol.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * To build (tested only on Linux): *

Copy X-Plane SDK to home directory, so that the headers can be found
at ~/SDK/CHeaders/XPLM (or edit the .pro file).
You'll need Qt development libraries installed.

qmake extplane-plugin.pro
make
copy libextplane-plugin.so.1.0.0 to X-Plane/Resources/plugins/extplane.xpl

 * To test: *

Launch X-Plane in console and observe the output. You should see something like:
TcpServer::TcpServer(QObject*, DataRefProvider*) Listening on port 51000

Open another console and run 'telnet localhost 51000'

When connected, try typing the following commands:

sub sim/cockpit/electrical/night_vision_on
set sim/cockpit/electrical/night_vision_on 1
set sim/cockpit/electrical/night_vision_on 0
sub sim/flightmodel/position/local_y 100
set sim/flightmodel/position/local_y 3000
disconnect

 * Command reference *

sub <dataref> [accuracy]   - Subscribe to dataref, with optional accuracy
unsub <dataref>            - Unsubscribe dataref
set <dataref> <value>      - Set dataref to value. Dataref must be subscribed first.
disconnect                 - Disconnect

With accuracy you can decide how much the dataref's value can
change before the update is sent. Set it to as large value as possible
to maximize frame rate.

 * Plugin output *

EXTPLANE <version>             - Sent when connected. Version number is currently 1.
u<type> <dataref> <value>      - Update of dataref

ExtPlane plugin outputs some log to stdout, so if you have problems with the
plugin, start X-Plane in console and read the output.

 * Features *

 - Multiple concurrent connections
 - Set and get datarefs
 - Dataref types: int, float and double
